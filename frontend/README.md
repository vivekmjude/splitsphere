# SplitSphere Frontend

This is the Next.js frontend for SplitSphere, built with an offline-first architecture using IndexedDB.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org) with App Router
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/) for IndexedDB management
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for state management

## Currently Supported Features

- Create and manage expenses with multiple participants
- Split bills evenly or with custom amounts
- Create and manage groups for shared expenses
- Add and manage friends
- Calculate settlements between users
- Record payments between users
- Offline-first operation with background sync
- Multi-currency support

## IndexedDB Implementation

SplitSphere uses an offline-first approach where:

- All data is stored in IndexedDB for local access
- Changes are made to local data first, then synced to the backend
- The app works fully offline with synchronization when online

Key components:
- `src/lib/db.ts` - IndexedDB database schema and helper functions
- `src/lib/sync.ts` - Backend synchronization utilities
- `src/store/*.ts` - State stores with IndexedDB integration
- `src/components/SyncStatus.tsx` - UI component showing sync status
- `src/components/providers/DbProvider.tsx` - Database initialization

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development

### Setting up for dev

During development, if you encounter database issues, you can reset the IndexedDB:

1. Open `src/components/providers/DbProvider.tsx`
2. Set `RESET_DB_ON_START` to `true` for a one-time database reset
3. Refresh the application

### State Management

All state is managed through Zustand stores that are backed by IndexedDB:

- `useExpenseStore` - Expense management
- `useGroupsStore` - Groups management
- `useFriendsStore` - Friends management

Each store follows the same pattern:
1. Load data from IndexedDB on initialization
2. Update IndexedDB first, then update UI state
3. Add changes to the sync queue for backend synchronization

### Testing Offline Mode

To test the offline capabilities:
1. Open the application normally
2. Use Chrome DevTools to toggle offline mode (Network tab â†’ Offline)
3. Add expenses, create groups, etc.
4. Toggle back to online mode
5. Click "Sync now" in the status indicator to manually trigger sync
